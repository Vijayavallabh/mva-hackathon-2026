# MVA Hackathon 2026

Working repo for [Rare Disease, Real Kid: The MVA Hackathon 2026](https://sagebio-rare-disease-real-kid-mva-hackathon-2026.hf.space/),
run by Sage Bionetworks with the MVA Society, Hugging Face and BEACON.

The dataset is whole-genome sequencing from one child with Mosaic Variegated
Aneuploidy, an ultra-rare condition with fewer than 50 known cases and no
established treatment. The family released it hoping someone finds the causal
variant. Two tracks:

- **Track 1 — variant prediction.** Rank the variant(s) driving the condition
  from the VCF, the FASTQ lanes and the clinical phenotype. Scored automatically
  against the NHS-confirmed answer on rank points and F-max. Six submissions allowed.
- **Track 2 — drug repurposing.** Characterize the mechanism and propose approved
  drugs that plausibly act on it. Judged by a panel on rigor (35%), impact (25%),
  innovation (25%), scalability (15%). One submission.

Submissions close **24 Oct 2026, 23:59 UTC**.

## This repository contains no subject data, and never will

Access is gated and the terms are binding, not advisory. `data/`, `results/` and
`logs/` are gitignored, every genomic file extension is gitignored everywhere,
and `scripts/no_data_in_git.sh` runs as a pre-commit hook that refuses any commit
touching them. A private repo still counts as a place data must be deleted from.

Everything must be deleted by **24 Nov 2026** and confirmed by email —
see `notes/deletion-plan.md`. Full rules in `AGENTS.md`.

## Setup

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a Hugging Face account approved for
`SageBio/mva-hackathon-2026-data`.

```bash
hf auth login                 # or export HF_TOKEN
./scripts/download_data.sh    # 85 GB into data/, resumable, ~25 min at 60 MB/s
./init.sh                     # env + integrity + safety gates
```

`init.sh` is idempotent and is the only setup step. It verifies every local file
against the remote dataset tree, so a partial download is reported rather than
silently analyzed.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data/` | 85 GB gated dataset: 1 VCF + index, 8 FASTQ lanes, clinical phenotype docx. Gitignored. |
| `scripts/` | `download_data.sh`, `verify_data.py`, `no_data_in_git.sh` |
| `notes/` | Tracked markdown: prior hypotheses, HPO terms, deletion plan |
| `results/` | Derived output. Gitignored — contains subject genotypes. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Working rules, access terms, definition of done |
| `feature_list.json` | Source of truth for what is done |
| `progress.md` | Session log |

## Status

feat-001 done: dataset downloaded and verified, 84.99 GB across 11 files.
feat-002 next: extract HPO terms from the clinical phenotype document.

The analysis plan runs VCF triage first, then realignment of the FASTQ lanes for
mosaic-aware calling and aneuploidy detection — the provided VCF is germline-called,
so low-VAF mosaic events and whole-chromosome changes are expected to be
under-represented in it. `notes/prior-knowledge.md` records the candidate genes
considered before any data was examined.
